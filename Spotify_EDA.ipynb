Formating columns and Encoding features**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bUWAf9Ah02_I"},"source":["Let's describe those audio features as Spotify mentioned it:\n","\n","\n","1.   **acousticness** (*float*): a confidence measure from ```0.0``` to ```1.0``` of whether the track is acoustic. ```1.0``` represents high confidence the )track is acoustic\n","\n","2.   **danceability** (*float*):  describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of ```0.0``` is least danceable and ```1.0``` is most danceable.\n","\n","3.   **energy** (*float*): is a measure from ```0.0``` to ```1.0``` and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n","\n","4.   **instrumentalness** (*float*): predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to ```1.0```, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above ```0.5``` are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches ```1.0```.\n","\n","5.   **key** (*integer*): the key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class Notation. E.g. ```0 = C```, ```1 = C♯/D♭```, ```2 = D```, and so on. \n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Integer_notation.png/525px-Integer_notation.png\">\n","</p>\n","\n","6.   **liveliness** (*float*): detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above ```0.8``` provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n","\n","7.   **loudness** (*float*): the overall loudness of a track in decibels (**dB**). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between ```-60``` and ```0``` db\n","\n","8.   **mode** (*integer*): indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by ```1``` and minor is ```0```.\n","\n","9.   **speechiness** (*float*): detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to ```1.0``` the attribute value. Values above ```0.66``` describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between ```0.33``` and ```0.66``` describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below ```0.33``` most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks\n","\n","10.  **tempo** (*float*): the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/65/a7/bc65a7c363b1487f9131a62ff7d5f2b6.png\">\n","</p>\n","\n","11.  **time_signature** (*integer*): an estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\n","\n","12.  **valence** (*float*): a measure from ```0.0``` to ```1.0``` describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rlnVhSKiqzKi"},"source":["# transform specific columns to integer\n","col_to_boolean = [\"shuffle\",\"offline\", \"incognito_mode\",
